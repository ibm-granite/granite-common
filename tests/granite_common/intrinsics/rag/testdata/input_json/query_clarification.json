This is often the case with operating system command shells.\n2. **Low resource requirements**: CLIs generally require fewer system resources to implement compared to GUIs.\n3. **Ease of accessing options**: With commands and their options given in a few characters, an experienced user might find it easier to access and remember the options in a CLI.\n4. **Automation of repetitive tasks**: CLIs often support mechanisms for storing frequently used command sequences in a disk file for re-use. This can extend to a scripting language that takes parameters and variable options.\n5. **Command history**: A command-line history can be kept, allowing review or repetition of commands.\nHowever, it's important to note that these advantages can depend on the specific use case and the user's familiarity with the CLI."

The extent of their territory before and during the Roman period is unclear , but is generally believed to include the whole of the island of Great Britain , at least as far north as the Clyde - Forth isthmus , and if the Picts are included as Brittonic speaking people ( as they more usually are ) , the entirety of Great Britain and its offshore island groups . The territory north of the Firth of Forth was largely inhabited by the Picts ; little direct evidence has been left of the Pictish language , but place names and Pictish personal names recorded in the later Irish annals suggest it was indeed related to the Common Brittonic language rather than to the Goidelic ( Gaelic ) languages of the Irish , Scots and Manx ; indeed their Goidelic Irish name , Cruithne , is cognate with Brythonic Priteni . After the invasion of north western Britain by Gaelic speaking Celts from Ireland from the 6th century AD onwards , part of the Pictish territory was eventually absorbed into the Gaelic kingdoms of Dál Riata and Alba , which became Scotland . The Isle of Man , Shetland , Hebrides and the Orkney islands were originally inhabited by Britons also , but eventually became respectively Manx and Scots Gaelic speaking territories , while the Scilly isles and Anglesey ( Ynys Mon ) remained Brittonic and the originally Brittonic Isle of Wight was taken by Anglo - Saxons ."

This is evidenced by the dropping of final syllables from Brittonic : * bardos `` poet '' became bardd , and * abona `` river '' became afon . Though both Davies and Jackson cite minor changes in syllable structure and sounds as evidence for the creation of Old Welsh , Davies suggests it may be more appropriate to refer to this derivative language as Lingua Brittanica rather than characterizing it as a new language altogether ."

He argued that the Brythonic languages originated in Gaul ( France ) , and that the Goidelic languages originated in the Iberian Peninsula . Lhuyd concluded that as the languages had been of Celtic origin , the people who spoke those languages were Celts . ( According to a more recent hypothesis , also widely embraced today , Goidelic and Brythonic languages , collectively known as Insular Celtic languages , evolved together for some time separately from Continental Celtic languages such as Gaulish and Celtiberian . ) From the 18th century , the peoples of Brittany , Cornwall , Ireland , Isle of Man , Scotland and Wales were known increasingly as Celts , and they are regarded as the modern Celtic nations today ."
