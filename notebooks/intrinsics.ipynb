Even absent a posted order on drones, it is within the discretion of park staff to contact drone operators when drones threaten visitors, property, wildlife, or privacy. If a drone operator continues to fly in a dangerous or reckless manner, they may be asked to stop flying and remove the drone from park boundaries.It is recommended that recreational drone operators consult the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) rules and regulations on the proper use of recreational drones and use common sense when operating these devices around crowded public areas, wildlife, or historic resources.\\nDPR requires compliance with the FAA guidelines for recreational Unmanned Aircraft Systems (https://www.faa.gov/uas/recreational_fliers/):\\n\\nFly below 400 feet and remain clear of surrounding obstacles;\\nKeep the aircraft within visual line of sight at all times;\\nRemain well clear of and do not interfere with manned aircraft operations;\\nDo not fly within 5 miles of an airport unless you contact the airport and control tower before flying;\\nDo not fly near people or stadiums;\\nDo not fly in adverse weather conditions such as in high winds or reduced visibility;\\nDo not fly under the influence of alcohol or drugs;\\nDo not fly an aircraft that weighs more than 55 lbs;\\nDo not fly near or over sensitive infrastructure or property such as power stations, water treatment facilities, correctional facilities, heavily traveled roadways, etc.;\\nDo not be careless or reckless with your unmanned aircraft – you could be fined for endangering people or other aircraft;\\nDo not conduct surveillance or photograph persons in areas where there is an expectation of privacy without the individual’s permission.\\n\\nCommercial Drones:The FAA requires commercial drone operators to receive special authorization; either a Section 333 Exemption or a Special Airworthiness Certificate. The FAA defines commercial drone use as, among other things: filming for hire; selling aerial photography or videography; inspections for hire; surveying for hire; or flying to further a business purpose. Operating a drone for commercial purposes within a state park also requires a permit. Commercial Drone users must submit a copy of their FAA authorization to the appropriate State Park District(s). Depending on the proposed use, the District Superintendent may require a Special Event permit, Right of Entry permit, or other approval. Further, commercial photography or filming within State Park also requires a permit from the California Film Commission. (Cal.

To ensure your visit is a pleasant one, please observe the following: NATURAL SCENERY, PLANTS AND ANIMAL LIFE are the principal attractions of most state parks. They are integral parts of the ecosystem and natural community. As such they are protected by Federal, State and Park laws. Disturbance or destruction of these resources is strictly forbidden. LOADED FIREARMS AND HUNTING are not allowed in units of the State Parks System. Possession of loaded firearms or air rifles is prohibited. Exceptions are for hunting in recreation areas that have been designated by the State Park and Recreation Commission. DEAD AND DOWN WOOD is part of the natural condition. Decayed vegetation forms humus and assists the growth of trees and other plants. For this reason the gathering of down wood is prohibited. Fuel is sold in the parks for your convenience. (When considered a hazard, down wood is removed by park personnel.) FIRES are permitted only in facilities provided for this purpose. This is necessary to prevent disastrous fires. Portable stoves may be used in designated areas. It is the responsibility of every visitor to use extreme caution with any burning materials, including tobacco. All fireworks are prohibited. ANIMALS, including cats, can not be turned loose in park units. All animals, other than grazing animals, must be under immediate physical control. Dogs must be on a tended leash no more than 6 feet or confined in an enclosed vehicle, tent or pen. Unless posted to the contrary, dogs, other than those that assist the permanently disabled, are prohibited on trails, beaches, and wherever posted.\", 'embedding': [0.07156462967395782,

Zoning regulations for arbors and patio covers are located in the Zoning Ordinance under Chapter 8.40.\\tZoning Ordinance\\n\\n3.\\nHow tall can my fence be?\\n\\r\\nFence height depends on the location of the fence. In most cases the height limit is six feet from grade. Fence regulations are in the Zoning Ordinance under Chapter 8.72.\\tZoning Ordinance\\n\\n4.\\nDo I need to obtain City approval for a room addition?\\n\\r\\nA site development review is required for all residential room additions which are 500 square feet in size or larger. A site development review is also required for all projects where 50% or more of the exterior walls of a house will be demolished (torn down). To gain approval, any proposed addition must meet development standards, which include setback and lot coverage requirements. Homeowners are encouraged to contact the Planning Division at (925) 833-6610 early in their planning process to determine the appropriate development standards for their property.\\t\\n\\n5.\\nWhat is a zone reclassification and when do I need one?\\n\\r\\nEach parcel within the City of Dublin has a zone classification. The allowable uses on each parcel, as well as the appropriate development standards, are determined by that parcel's zone classification. In certain cases, the City Council may authorize a zone reclassification, provided that the proposed zone is consistent with the General Plan. To institute a zone reclassification, an application must be filed with the Planning Division. \\t\\n\\n6.\\nWhat is a variance and when do I need one?\\n\\r\\nIn rare cases, property owners can be granted an exception or variance from a development standard, such as setback requirements or coverage limitations. A variance can only be granted for relief from a particular development standard. A variance can never be granted to allow land uses prohibited by the property's zone classification.\\t\\n\\n7.\\nWhat is a use permit and when do I need one?\\n\\r\\nCertain land uses have the potential to negatively impact adjoining parcels, unless certain conditions are imposed. In those cases, conditions are imposed by use permits to ensure compatibility of land uses. Typically, these conditions limit the types of activity allowed on the parcel and limit the hours of operation. A use permit can be revoked if the property owner fails to honor the conditions of approval of the permit.\\t\\n\\n8.\", 'embedding': [0.004891766235232353, 0.1213441863656044, -0.06429829448461533,

Proof of a state-approved rabies vaccination is needed to obtain a license. Discounted licensing fees are offered for sterilized dogs with a copy of a sterility certificate signed by a veterinarian licensed to practice in the state. Senior citizen discount fees are offered with proof of dog’s sterility certificate and a copy of any document showing the birth date of the person (i.e., driver’s license, state ID, or birth certificate). Only one senior citizen license discount allowed per household. A no charge license is provided for guide dogs with proof of certification.

Zoning regulations for arbors and patio covers are located in the Zoning Ordinance under Chapter 8.40.\\tZoning Ordinance\\n\\n3.\\nHow tall can my fence be?\\n\\r\\nFence height depends on the location of the fence. In most cases the height limit is six feet from grade. Fence regulations are in the Zoning Ordinance under Chapter 8.72.\\tZoning Ordinance\\n\\n4.\\nDo I need to obtain City approval for a room addition?\\n\\r\\nA site development review is required for all residential room additions which are 500 square feet in size or larger. A site development review is also required for all projects where 50% or more of the exterior walls of a house will be demolished (torn down). To gain approval, any proposed addition must meet development standards, which include setback and lot coverage requirements. Homeowners are encouraged to contact the Planning Division at (925) 833-6610 early in their planning process to determine the appropriate development standards for their property.\\t\\n\\n5.\\nWhat is a zone reclassification and when do I need one?\\n\\r\\nEach parcel within the City of Dublin has a zone classification. The allowable uses on each parcel, as well as the appropriate development standards, are determined by that parcel's zone classification. In certain cases, the City Council may authorize a zone reclassification, provided that the proposed zone is consistent with the General Plan. To institute a zone reclassification, an application must be filed with the Planning Division. \\t\\n\\n6.\\nWhat is a variance and when do I need one?\\n\\r\\nIn rare cases, property owners can be granted an exception or variance from a development standard, such as setback requirements or coverage limitations. A variance can only be granted for relief from a particular development standard. A variance can never be granted to allow land uses prohibited by the property's zone classification.\\t\\n\\n7.\\nWhat is a use permit and when do I need one?\\n\\r\\nCertain land uses have the potential to negatively impact adjoining parcels, unless certain conditions are imposed. In those cases, conditions are imposed by use permits to ensure compatibility of land uses. Typically, these conditions limit the types of activity allowed on the parcel and limit the hours of operation. A use permit can be revoked if the property owner fails to honor the conditions of approval of the permit.\\t\\n\\n8.\", 'embedding': [0.004891766235232353, 0.1213441863656044, -0.06429829448461533,

Proof of a state-approved rabies vaccination is needed to obtain a license. Discounted licensing fees are offered for sterilized dogs with a copy of a sterility certificate signed by a veterinarian licensed to practice in the state. Senior citizen discount fees are offered with proof of dog’s sterility certificate and a copy of any document showing the birth date of the person (i.e., driver’s license, state ID, or birth certificate). Only one senior citizen license discount allowed per household. A no charge license is provided for guide dogs with proof of certification.

The setback is the area between your property line and the street. It's usually 20 feet from the property line for front yard fences. However, these rules can vary based on specific circumstances, so it's always best to check with the Dublin Planning Department or visit their official website for the most accurate and current information."
